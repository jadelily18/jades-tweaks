This pack is my personal modified version of [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/), along with some assets from other packs (see [credits](#credits)), that I use in Minecraft: Java Edition. It's intended to be used with [my modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/jpp) or something like [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized).
